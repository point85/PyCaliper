v1.1.0, February 15, 2026:	
- Claude Sonnet 4.5
Bug - Test Import Failure (test/init.py)
Fixed os.chdir("../uom") that was breaking tests when run from different locations

Performance Enhancements:
Dictionary Operations Optimization (unit_of_measure.py)
Removed unnecessary .keys() calls when checking membership (2 locations)
Optimized dict iteration in buildBaseString() - sort dict directly instead of keys
Improved multiplyOrDivide() - use tuple unpacking in for loops and .get() method
Optimized classify() - use .get() instead of checking membership then accessing
Major optimization in getConversionFactor() - replaced nested O(n²) loop with O(n) lookup using dict comprehension
Prefix Class Caching (prefix.py)

Implemented instance caching for all 22 prefix methods (milli, kilo, mega, etc.)
Previously created new objects on every call; now returns cached instances
Significant performance improvement for measurement system initialization

Symbol Generation Optimization (unit_of_measure.py)
Replaced expensive time.time_ns() call with simple counter
Much faster for intermediate unit generation

Power Calculation Optimization (unit_of_measure.py)

Replaced loop-based power calculation with math.pow() in Reducer.explodeRecursively()
More efficient and clearer code
Localizer Optimization (localizer.py)

Added @lru_cache decorator to getLC() method for language code lookup
Fixed __init__ to properly check _initialized attribute
Prevents repeated locale lookups
